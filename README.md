README for Lottery system 

We currently have a Ballot.sol and test.sol which do not reference the homework.They are there for me to learn solidity. The file we should work off of is Lottery.sol which is currently a copy of another Github repo. 

The code has some errors.

We should also just stick to an even chance of winning the lottery despite the number of ether the participant wager.
